This roll bundles a collection of Python scientific computing modules: ipython,
matplotlib, nose, numpy, pyfits, pytz, and scipy.  To install, execute these
instructions on a Rocks development machine (e.g., a frontend), starting in
this directory:

% make
% rocks add roll *.iso
% rocks enable roll scipy
% cd /export/rocks/install
% rocks create distro
% rocks run roll scipy | bash

This roll source supports building with different compilers; by default, it
builds using the gnu compilers.  To build for a different configuration, use
the ROLLCOMPILER make variable, e.g.,

% make ROLLCOMPILER=intel

The build process currently supports one or more of the values "gnu", "intel",
and "pgi" for the ROLLCOMPILER variable, defaulting to "gnu".

NOTE: the BLAS and ATLAS dynamic libraries need to be installed in order to
build this roll.  The intel compiler comes packaged with these.

The roll also supports specifying building with/for a python version other than
the one included with the o/s.  To use this feature, specify a ROLLOPTS make
variable that includes the path to the python executable, e.g.,

% make ROLLOPTS='python=/opt/python/bin/python2.7'
