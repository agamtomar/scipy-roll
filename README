This roll source supports building with different compilers and python
interpreters.  By default, it builds using the gnu compilers and the system
python.  To build for a different configuration, use the ROLLCOMPILER,
PYTHON, and ROLLPYTHONLIB make variables, e.g.,

make ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLPYTHON=/opt/python/bin/python ROLLPYTHONLIB=/opt/python/lib/python2.7

The build process currently supports the values "intel" and "gnu" for the
ROLLCOMPILER variable, defaulting to "gnu".

If the ROLLCOMPILER variable is specified, its value is incorporated into the
names of the produced roll and rpms, e.g.,

make ROLLCOMPILER=intel

produces a roll with a name that begins "scipy-intel"; it contains and
installs a similarly-named rpm.

NOTE: the BLAS and ATLAS dynamic libraries need to be installed in order to
build this roll.  The intel compiler comes packaged with these.
